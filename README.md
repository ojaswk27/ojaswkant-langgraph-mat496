# Introduction to langgraph; Module 1

## Video 1: Simple Graph
This is a video about simple graphs and their construction. Here we learn how to build a LangGraph with 3 nodes and conditional routing. We define a state schema, create node functions that modify the state, add a conditional edge that routes between nodes based on a 50/50, compiles the graph and invokes it to show execution flow.

## Video 2: LangSmith Studio
This video introduces us to LangSmith Studio, a tool for viewing and "chatting" to our graphs. LangChain calls this a "agent IDE" and we can use this to visualize, interact with, and debug complex agentic applications. I have set it up and gotten it running, but it requires an OpenAI API key, which I hope to replace with an Anthropic key.
