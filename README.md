# Introduction to langgraph; Module 1

## Video 1: Simple Graph
This is a video about simple graphs and their construction. Here we learn how to build a LangGraph with 3 nodes and conditional routing. We define a state schema, create node functions that modify the state, add a conditional edge that routes between nodes based on a 50/50, compiles the graph and invokes it to show execution flow.
